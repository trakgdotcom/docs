Trakg works seamlessly with React by using a simple `<script>` tag that tracks all form interactions — including abandoned fields. You don’t need to modify your form structure or write any special handlers.

---

## 📦 Where to add the script

In most React apps created with Create React App (CRA), the best place to add the Trakg script is inside the `public/index.html` file.

### ✅ Recommended placement

Paste the following line **before the closing `</body>` tag** inside `public/index.html`:

```jsx
<!-- Trakg Script -->
<script
  src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

🔁 Replace `YOUR_ID_GIVEN` with the unique Site ID from your Trakg dashboard.

## 📁 Full Example: `public/index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<title>My React App</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="root"></div>

		<!-- ✅ Trakg script just before closing body -->
		<script
			defer
			src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
		></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

## 🛡 Best Practices

✅ Always use the `defer` attribute — it ensures the script loads after HTML is parsed  
✅ Keep the script at the end of the `<body>` for non-blocking performance  
✅ No need to wrap your form with providers or HOCs — Trakg works with standard HTML form tags  
✅ Works with any form built using `form`, `input`, `textarea`, or `select`
