Trakg is framework-agnostic ‚Äî meaning it works with **any tech stack** that renders HTML forms on the web. Whether you're using React, Next.js, Vue, Laravel, or just plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript, setup is always fast and non-intrusive.

All you need to do is embed the Trakg script on pages that contain forms. Trakg will automatically detect form interactions and start tracking instantly.

## One Script to Track Them All

No matter what your tech stack is, the integration stays the same:

```html
<script
	defer
	src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

üîÅ You don‚Äôt need to change any form code. Trakg automatically tracks field inputs, timings, and drop-offs.
