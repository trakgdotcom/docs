Trakg works seamlessly with both **App Router** and **Pages Router** in Next.js. It captures user interactions on any form built with standard HTML elements, and gives you real-time insights — with zero backend config.

---

## 📦 Installation Overview

All you need is to embed the Trakg tracking script. We recommend using Next.js’s built-in `<Script />` component for better performance.

🔁 **Replace `YOUR_ID_GIVEN` with your actual Site ID** found in your Trakg dashboard.

---

## ⚙️ App Router (Next.js 13+)

If you're using the App Router (`/app` directory), you can add the script inside your `layout.tsx` or `layout.js` file — which wraps all routes.

### Example: `app/layout.tsx`

```tsx
import Script from "next/script";

export default function RootLayout({children}: {children: React.ReactNode}) {
	return (
		<html lang='en'>
			<body>
				{children}

				{/* ✅ Trakg Script */}
				<Script
					defer
					src='https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN'
					strategy='afterInteractive'
				/>
			</body>
		</html>
	);
}
```

## 📁 Pages Router

If you're using the traditional Pages Router (`/pages` directory), include the Trakg script in your custom `_document.js`.

### Example: `pages/\_document.js

```tsx
import {Html, Head, Main, NextScript} from "next/document";

export default function Document() {
	return (
		<Html lang='en'>
			<Head />
			<body>
				<Main />
				<NextScript />

				{/* ✅ Trakg Script */}
				<script
					defer
					src='https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN'
				></script>
			</body>
		</Html>
	);
}
```

## 🛡 Best Practices

⚠️ You must use a standard `<script defer />` here — since **Next.js** does **not support** `<Script />` from `next/script` inside `_document.js`.

---

**Recommendations**

-   **Always use the `defer` attribute** — ensures the script loads after the HTML is parsed.
-   **For App Router**, prefer `<Script strategy="afterInteractive" />` from `next/script`.
-   **Keep the script at the end of `<body>`** for non-blocking performance.
-   **No need to modify your forms** — Trakg supports native `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` elements.
-   **Works with any form library or custom UI inputs** — as long as native HTML form elements are rendered in the DOM.

---

## 🚀 You're Ready!

Once the script is added, Trakg will automatically:

-   🔍 Track user interactions on your forms
-   📝 Capture partially filled form data
-   ✅ Log completed submissions
-   📊 Display real-time analytics in your dashboard
-   🔁 Help you recover abandoned leads
