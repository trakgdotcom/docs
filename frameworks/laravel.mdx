## 🧩 Laravel Integration Guide

You can integrate **Trakg** into your Laravel app effortlessly by adding a single script tag.

### ✅ Basic Setup (Blade Template)

Insert the following script in your main Blade layout, typically found at:

```php
// resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php or similar
```

Place it **right before the closing `</body>` tag**:

```html
<!-- Trakg Tracking Script -->
<script defer src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"></script>
```

🔁 **Replace `YOUR_ID_GIVEN` with your actual Site ID from the Trakg dashboard.**

## ⚙️ Best Practices

- ✅ Always use `defer` to prevent blocking page rendering.
- ✅ Keep the script at the end of `<body>` for better performance.
- ✅ No need to change your form markup — Trakg works with native `form`, `input`, `textarea`, and `select` elements.
- ✅ It supports Blade forms, Livewire forms, and even Alpine.js interactivity.
