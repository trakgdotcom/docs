## 💡 Getting Started with HTML/CSS/JS

Trakg works out of the box with any static or dynamic website built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### ✅ Recommended Setup

Just add the following script **before the closing `</body>` tag** in your main HTML file:

```html
<!-- Trakg Tracking Script -->
<script
	defer
	src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

🔁 Replace `YOUR_ID_GIVEN` with the unique Site ID from your [Trakg Dashboard](https://trakg.com/dashboard).

### 📁 Example: `index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>My Website</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<form>
			<input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" />
			<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" />
			<button type="submit">Submit</button>
		</form>

		<!-- ✅ Trakg script just before closing body -->
		<script
			defer
			src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
		></script>
	</body>
</html>
```

### 🛡 Best Practices

✅ Use `defer` to ensure the script loads after HTML is parsed  
✅ Keep the script at the end of the `<body>` for best performance  
✅ Works with any form using native `form`, `input`, `textarea`, or `select` tags  
✅ No need for extra configuration or dependencies

### 🚀 You're Ready!

Once the script is added, Trakg will automatically:

-   Track user interactions on your forms
-   Capture partially filled form data
-   Log completed submissions
-   Show real-time analytics in your Trakg dashboard
