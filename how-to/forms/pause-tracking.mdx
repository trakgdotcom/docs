## Pause Tracking on a Form

By default, **Trakg automatically tracks** all form interactions on your website ‚Äî including typing, blurs, focus, and submissions ‚Äî for every `<form>` element detected on a verified website.

If you want to **pause or disable tracking** for a specific form (e.g., sensitive or internal forms like admin logins, payment forms, etc.), you can use the special attribute:

```html
trakg-form-track="notrack"
```

### Example: This form will NOT be tracked

```html
<form trakg-form-track="notrack">
	<input type="password" name="admin-password" />
	<button type="submit">Login</button>
</form>
```

This tells **Trakg** not to track any inputs or interactions inside this form.

### üîê Best Practice

Use `trakg-form-track="notrack"` on:

-   Admin login forms
-   Sensitive data collection forms (e.g., card inputs, internal forms)
-   Third-party or embedded forms you don‚Äôt want monitored

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Trakg tracks all forms by default unless explicitly disabled using this attribute. Always review sensitive areas and opt out where needed.
