To track a form using Trakg, you don't need to manually register it. The process is automatic once setup is complete.

## Prerequisites

- A **website** must be created in your Trakg Dashboard.
- The **tracking script** must be correctly added to your website.

## How It Works

- Once the tracking script is installed, simply **submit a test (dummy) lead** by filling out a form on your website.
- When the form is interacted with and a lead is captured, Trakg will automatically detect and create the form in your **Forms Panel**.

## Identification

- Trakg uses the `<form>` element’s `name` attribute (if present) to uniquely identify forms.
- If `name` is not set, Trakg will use the form’s URL path and index.
- We **recommend using a `name` attribute** on each form for better readability and management.

```html
<form name="contact-form">
  <!-- Your input fields -->
</form>
```
## Important Notes

- Only `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, and other valid form elements **inside a `<form>` tag** are captured.
- Avoid using `<section>` or `<div>` to wrap form fields if you want them tracked. Always use a proper `<form>` tag.
- To uniquely identify a form in the dashboard, you can use either:
  - the native `name` attribute: `<form name="contact-form">`  
  - **or** the custom `data-trakg-form-name` attribute: `<form data-trakg-form-name="contact-form">`

### ✅ This **will be captured**:

```html
<form name="newsletter">
  <input type="email" name="email" />
  <button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
</form>
```

### ❌ This will NOT be captured:
```html
<div>
  <input type="email" name="email" />
</div>
```
ℹ️ Your form will appear in the dashboard only after a successful interaction like typing or submitting a dummy entry.
