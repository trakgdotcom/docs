# Website Verification Guide

<Badge variant="info">Required for Lead Capture</Badge>

Before Trakg can start tracking your forms and capturing leads, your website must be **verified**. This ensures that the tracking script is properly installed and active.

## üß≠ How Verification Works

When you add a new website to your [Trakg Dashboard](https://app.trakg.com), you'll receive a **unique tracking script**.

To verify your website:

1. **Copy the Script**  
   After adding a site on Trakg, copy the generated `<script>` code assigned to your website.

2. **Paste the Script into Your Website**  
   - Insert the script **just before the closing `</body>` tag** on all pages where you want tracking.
   - For platforms like WordPress, Webflow, Wix, etc., check our [installation guides](/docs/integrations/overview).

3. **Go Back to Trakg Dashboard ‚Üí Websites Panel**  
   Return to the **Websites** section in your dashboard.

4. **Click the "Verify" Button**  
   Once the script is active on your site, click the **Verify** button next to your site entry.

## ‚úÖ What Happens After Verification?

- Trakg checks if the script is properly installed and responding.
- Once verified, your site status will change to **"Verified"**.
- From this point forward, form activity and lead data will start appearing in your dashboard.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

- If your site is **not verified**, **no leads will be captured**.
- Always ensure the script is included on all pages with forms you want tracked.
- If you're using a single-page app (SPA), ensure the script persists across navigation.
