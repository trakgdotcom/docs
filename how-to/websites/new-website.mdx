Add a new website to start tracking forms, analytics, and leads in your Trakg dashboard.

## Steps to Add a New Website

1. **Log in** to your [Trakg Dashboard](https://app.trakg.com)
2. In the sidebar, navigate to the **Websites** section.
3. Click the **Add New Website** button.

## Fill in the Details

You will be asked to enter the following:

-   **Website URL**:  
    Enter the full domain (e.g., `https://example.com`). Make sure it includes the correct protocol (`http` or `https`).

-   **Website Name**:  
    Give your website a short, recognizable name. This is just for internal use in the dashboard.

-   **Admin Email**:  
    The email address where notifications, alerts, or reports related to this website will be sent.

-   **Admin Name**:  
    The name of the website owner or person responsible for form tracking. This will appear in communications.

## What Happens Next?

-   Once saved, you’ll be provided with a **tracking script** to embed in your website.
-   Your website will remain **unverified** until the script is properly installed.
-   After script installation, return to the **Websites panel** and click **Verify** to start capturing leads.

> ⚠️ Note: No form data will be captured unless your website is verified.
