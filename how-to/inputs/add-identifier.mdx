By default, Trakg uses the `name`, `id`, or `placeholder` attribute of an `<input>` field to label data on your dashboard.

If none of these are present, Trakg will generate a random identifier, which may lead to messy or unclear data labels.

### ✅ Best Practice

To ensure clean and readable analytics:

-   Always add a meaningful `name` attribute to your inputs.
-   If `name` is missing, provide an `id` or a user-friendly `placeholder`.
-   Avoid leaving input fields without any identifying attribute.

### 📌 Example

```html
<!-- Good -->
<input type="email" name="user_email" placeholder="Email Address" />

<!-- OK -->
<input type="email" id="user-email" />

<!-- Not Recommended (Trakg will auto-generate a label) -->
<input type="email" />
```

⚠️ Without a proper identifier, fields may appear as random codes in your dashboard. Use `name`, `id`, or `placeholder` to keep things organized.
