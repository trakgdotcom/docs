If you want **Trakg** to skip tracking a specific input field inside a form, you can explicitly disable tracking on that input using the following attribute:

```html
<input name="secret" trakg-input-no-track="true" />
```

Trakg will ignore this input entirely — no typing, focus, or blur data will be collected.

## 🔐 Password Field Handling

* Inputs with `type="password"` are **never tracked** by Trakg, even without the `trakg-input-no-track` attribute.

* If a password field is changed to `type="text"` (e.g., during "show password" interactions), Trakg **might** track it unless you explicitly mark it as not tracked.

* For extra safety, always use `trakg-input-no-track="true"` on sensitive fields like passwords or payment data.

### ✅ Example

```html
<form>
	<input type="email" name="email" />
	<input type="password" name="password" trakg-input-no-track="true" />
</form>
```
