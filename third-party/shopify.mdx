## Installing Trakg on Shopify

To integrate Trakg with your Shopify store:

### Option 1: Add to Theme (Recommended)

1. Go to your **Shopify Admin** panel
2. Click **Online Store ‚Üí Themes ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Edit Code**
3. In the left sidebar, open `layout/theme.liquid`
4. Paste the following script **just before the closing `</body>` tag**:

```html
<script
	defer
	src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

> üîÅ Replace `YOUR_ID_GIVEN` with your actual Site ID from your [Trakg Dashboard](https://app.trakg.com)

5. Click **Save**

---

### Option 2: Use a Shopify App (If theme editing is restricted)

You can use apps like:

-   **Custom JavaScript & CSS by Voidworks**
-   **ScriptTag Manager**

These allow injecting custom scripts without editing theme code.

## Best Practices

-   ‚úÖ Always use the `defer` attribute for non-blocking performance
-   ‚úÖ Insert the script before the closing `</body>` tag
-   ‚úÖ No need to change your forms or use any wrappers
-   ‚úÖ Trakg works with all native HTML forms and most Shopify form apps (e.g., Contact Form, Klaviyo)
