## Installing Trakg on WordPress

Trakg works seamlessly with WordPress. You can track form interactions and recover leads without modifying your forms or backend logic.

### Option 1: Add Script via Theme Settings (Recommended)

Most WordPress themes (like Astra, Hello, or Blocksy) allow you to insert custom scripts into the `<head>` or before the `</body>` tag.

1. Log in to your **WordPress Admin Panel**
2. Navigate to:  
   **Appearance → Theme File Editor** (or **Customizer → Additional Scripts**, depending on your theme)
3. Paste the following just **before the closing `</body>` tag**:

```html
<script
	defer
	src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

**Replace `YOUR_ID_GIVEN` with your actual Site ID**

You can find your Site ID in the [Trakg Dashboard](https://app.trakg.com).

## Option 2: Use a Plugin (If Theme Doesn’t Support Scripts)

If your WordPress theme does not allow inserting scripts directly, you can use a plugin like:

-   [Insert Headers and Footers by WPCode](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/)
-   [Header Footer Code Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/header-footer-code-manager/)

### Steps

1. Install and activate one of the above plugins.
2. Go to **Settings → Insert Headers and Footers** (or the plugin’s UI).
3. Paste the Trakg script **in the Footer section**:

```html
<script
	defer
	src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

4. Click Save.

## Best Practices

-   Use the `defer` attribute for better performance
-   Place the script just before the closing `</body>` tag
-   No need to wrap or modify your forms
-   Works with native HTML forms and most WordPress form plugins (e.g., Contact Form 7, WPForms, Elementor)

## You're Ready!

Once the script is installed:

-   Trakg will automatically track form field interactions and clicks
-   Partially filled data will be captured even without submission
-   You can view leads, drop-offs, and analytics in your Trakg Dashboard
-   Recover lost conversions easily
