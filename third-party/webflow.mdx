## Installing Trakg on a Webflow Site

To integrate Trakg with your Webflow site:

1. Open your **Webflow Project Settings**
2. Go to the **Custom Code** tab
3. In the **Footer Code** section, paste the following script:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

> Replace `YOUR_ID_GIVEN` with your actual Site ID from your [Trakg Dashboard](https://app.trakg.com)

4. Click **Save Changes**
5. Re-publish your Webflow site

## Best Practices

- ✅ Use the `defer` attribute for non-blocking load  
- ✅ Add the script in the **Footer Code** section (before `</body>`)  
- ✅ No need to wrap your forms in providers or change their structure  
- ✅ Trakg works with native `form`, `input`, `textarea`, and `select` tags used in Webflow

## You're Ready!

Once the script is installed:

- Form activity will be tracked automatically  
- Trakg will capture partially filled data — even if the form isn’t submitted  
- All data will appear in your [Trakg Dashboard](https://app.trakg.com)  
- Export leads, view drop-offs, and recover lost conversions
