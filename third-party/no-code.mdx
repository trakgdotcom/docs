## Installing Trakg on No-Code Platforms

Trakg works seamlessly with most no-code builders as long as you can insert a custom `<script>` tag in the site’s `<body>` or footer. Below are instructions for popular tools:

---

### **1. Squarespace**

1. Go to your Squarespace **Admin Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings → Advanced → Code Injection**
3. Paste the following script into the **Footer** section:

```html
<script
	defer
	src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

4. Click **Save**

> Replace `YOUR_ID_GIVEN` with your actual Trakg Site ID from [your dashboard](https://app.trakg.com)

---

### **2. Webflow**

1. Open your Webflow **Project Settings**
2. Go to the **Custom Code** tab
3. Scroll to the **Footer Code** section
4. Paste the Trakg script **before the closing `</body>` tag**:

```html
<script
	defer
	src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

5. Publish your site

## Best Practices

-   Always use the `defer` attribute for better performance
-   Insert the script just before the closing `</body>` tag
-   No need to modify or wrap your forms
-   Trakg works with native HTML forms and most form builders (like Tally, Typeform embeds, Contact Form, etc.)

---

## You're Ready!

Once the script is installed:

-   Trakg will start tracking form interactions, field activity, and drop-offs
-   You'll see partially filled form data in your [Trakg Dashboard](https://app.trakg.com)
-   You can export leads, analyze user intent, and recover lost conversions
