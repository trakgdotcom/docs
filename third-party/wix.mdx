## Installing Trakg on a Wix Site

To install the Trakg script on your Wix site:

1. Open your **Wix Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Settings → Custom Code**
3. Click **Add Custom Code**
4. Paste the following Trakg script:

```html
<script
  defer
  src="https://cdn.trakg.com/api/v1/tracker.min.js?id=YOUR_ID_GIVEN"
></script>
```

> Replace `YOUR_ID_GIVEN` with your actual Site ID from your [Trakg Dashboard](https://app.trakg.com)

5. Select **Body - end** as the location
6. Apply it to **All Pages**
7. Save and publish

## Best Practices

- ✅ Use the `defer` attribute for better performance  
- ✅ Place the script just before the closing `</body>` tag  
- ✅ No need to wrap or modify your forms  
- ✅ Works with most Wix forms that use native HTML input elements
