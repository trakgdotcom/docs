## Welcome to Trakg 👋

**Trakg** helps you recover leads from users who start filling out forms but never hit “submit.”

It captures partial submissions, tracks user interactions, and gives you actionable insights to boost conversions — all without needing to modify your forms or set up a backend.

---

Every day, businesses lose valuable leads because of incomplete forms — whether it's on a contact page, support form, sign-up flow, or checkout. Users may start typing, hesitate, get distracted, or encounter friction… and leave. These are high-intent users, and Trakg helps you bring them back.

Trakg works silently in the background to:

-   Track every interaction with your form fields (starts typing, leaves a field, hovers, clicks, etc.)
-   Save form data in real-time — even before submission
-   Record how much time users spend on each form and field
-   Identify which fields users drop off from the most
-   Surface a list of **abandoned leads** with partially filled data

It gives your team a clear view of what’s working, what’s not, and who could’ve converted — but didn’t.

---
