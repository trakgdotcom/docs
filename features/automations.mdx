Trakg is building powerful automation tools to help you **react in real time to form events** — such as abandoned submissions, lead source, or geography — and trigger smart workflows like emails, follow-ups, and notifications.

> 🚧 This feature is actively being developed and will be launched soon.

With Automations, you’ll soon be able to:

-   ✅ Trigger workflows when a form is submitted, partially filled, or abandoned
-   🌍 Filter leads by country, device, referral, time spent, and more
-   ✉️ Send follow-up emails for abandoned forms
-   🔔 Alert sales teams in Slack or CRM
-   🔄 Connect to Zapier, n8n, Make, or your custom webhooks

## 🔧 Example Use Cases

-   **If a user fills 3 fields and drops off**, send a reminder email in 10 minutes
-   **If a user is from Canada and abandons checkout**, alert the regional sales rep
-   **If a form is submitted from a mobile device**, trigger a personalized SMS flow
-   **Auto-segment leads** based on UTM tags or source (e.g., Google Ads vs Organic)
