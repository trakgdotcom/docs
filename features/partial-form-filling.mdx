title: Partial Form Filling
description: "Track and recover leads even if the user didn’t submit your form"
---

Trakg enables your business to capture form input **even if users don’t hit 'Submit'**. This means you no longer lose valuable insights when someone starts filling a form but abandons it midway.

## 🔍 What It Does

Trakg listens to form activity in real-time and tracks every user interaction like:

-   Typing into input fields
-   Selecting options from dropdowns
-   Checking checkboxes or radio buttons
-   Navigating between fields (focus and blur)
-   Time spent on each field

All of this data is captured and sent securely to your Trakg dashboard.

## 🏆 Benefits

-   **Recover Lost Leads**  
    Know exactly who showed interest but didn’t complete the form.

-   **Understand Drop-Off Behavior**  
    Learn which fields users drop off at or find confusing.

-   **Real-Time Tracking**  
    View inputs as they happen, not just after submission.

-   **Boost Conversion Rates**  
    Follow up intelligently using partial data before the lead is lost forever.

## 📊 What Data Is Collected?

When a visitor interacts with your form, Trakg captures:

-   **Partially filled field data** (text typed, selected options)
-   **What was typed and later removed**
-   **Form engagement timing** (how long they stayed on each field)
-   **Form start and abandon time**
-   **Visitor metadata**:
    -   Referrer URL
    -   UTM parameters
    -   Device type (mobile, desktop, tablet)
    -   Geolocation (approx. country or region)
    -   Browser and OS

## 🔐 Privacy & Data Protection

We take privacy seriously. Trakg has **built-in filters** that automatically exclude:

-   Passwords and password-like fields
-   Credit card or financial input fields
-   Sensitive personal or confidential information

We use field names, input types, and patterns (e.g., "ssn", "cardNumber", etc.) to detect and exclude sensitive content from tracking.

---

## ⚙️ Custom Filtering & Exclusions

Want to block certain fields or forms from being tracked?

-   You can exclude any input field or form using `data-trakg-ignore` attribute.
-   Example:

    ```html
    <input name="ssn" data-trakg-ignore />
    ```
