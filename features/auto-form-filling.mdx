Trakg offers an intelligent **Auto Form Filling** feature that enhances user experience and helps businesses recover more conversions.

When enabled, this feature automatically fills form fields for returning users using the data they entered in **previous forms** on your website — even if those forms were not submitted.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

-   Trakg stores the user's previously typed form data (e.g., name, email, phone) in the browser’s `localStorage`.
-   When the same user visits another page with a different form, matching fields (by `name` attribute) are auto-filled with that saved data.
-   If a user **updates** any value in a new form, that change is **immediately synced** across all forms where the data appears.
-   Data is stored **locally on the user’s browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) and is never sent elsewhere unless the user submits the form.

---

## ⏳ Data Expiry

-   The stored data remains valid for up to **24 hours**.
-   After 24 hours of inactivity, the data is automatically cleared.
-   If the user clears their browser storage or uses incognito/private mode, the autofill may not persist.

---

## 🛡 Privacy & Security

Trakg is privacy-focused by design:

-   Only non-sensitive fields (like name, email, phone, company) are eligible for autofill.
-   Fields like passwords, financial info, personal IDs, or fields explicitly marked with filters are **never stored or autofilled**.
-   All storage and matching happens locally in the browser via `localStorage`.

---

## ✅ Benefits for Businesses

-   Increase conversions by reducing the effort for returning users to fill forms again.
-   Seamless multi-step or multi-page form experiences.
-   Users can recover and complete forms they started earlier.

---

## 🚀 Example Use Cases

-   A user fills a form on your homepage, then navigates to a pricing/contact page — the second form is already filled.
-   Multi-step lead journeys where forms are split across pages (common in insurance, SaaS, real estate, etc.).

---

## 💡 Notes

-   This feature is optional and can be toggled from your Trakg dashboard.
-   Developers can opt out of auto-filling specific forms or fields using `data-trakg-nofill` attributes.
